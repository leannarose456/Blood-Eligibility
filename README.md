# Blood-Eligibility
A couple functions that test user input to see what blood donation services they qualify for. 

Hello! My project is a user friendly application that with just some basic information
will tell you what blood donations they are eligible for! This project will return
either "a Whole Blood donation", "a Power Red Donation" or both.
I will take in demographics such as: height, weight, age, and gender and use that to compare
and decide if that individual meets requirements for blood donations.

I am making this project to make it one step easier in deciding if donating blood 
is right for someone, and giving them the information needed to make the correct appointment.
